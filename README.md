# TypeScript project for React/Redux/Jest/Enzyme/Styled-Components
The goal of this project is to be a reference point on how to accomplish TS related things in a modern React app. I want this project to work just like a create-react-app meaning you can have images in the same place, test files, environment variables etc etc.

---

## Running the app
`yarn start`

---

## Testing the app
`yarn test`

---

## Builing the app
`yarn build`

---

## TypeScript validating the app
`yarn types`
